      Maybe build a table here for this information.<br>

      Date: (Data from RTC) <br>
      Last Outside Temp: (From OneWire)<br>
      Last Inside Temp: (From Humidity Sensor)<br>
      Last Inside Humidity: (From Humidity Sensor)<br>

      Could I build a set of links dynamically from the OpenLog Storage? <br>
      
      Or Just a link directly to the mounted card? <br>
      Have to read more about this. <br>
